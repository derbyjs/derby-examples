  "readme": "# LIVE DB!\n\nThis is a database wrapper which exposes the API that realtime databases should\nhave.\n\nYou can submit operations (edit documents) and subscribe to documents.\nSubscribing gives you a stream of all operations applied to theh given\ndocument. You can also make queries, which give you a feed of changes in the\nresult set while the query is open.\n\nCurrently this is very new and only used by ShareJS. To use it, you need a snapshot database wrapper. The obvious choice is mongodb. A database wrapper for mongo is available in [share/livedb-mongo](https://github.com/share/livedb-mongo).\n",
